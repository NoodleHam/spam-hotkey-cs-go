Alright guys, I'm doing "Take On Me" now
Alright, ha-pa-ba-ba-ba
I, I really, I really like this song, it sounds good
Minin' away, I don't know what to mine
I'll mine this anyway in this Minecraft day
So beautiful, mine further down
What's that I found?
Mine diamonds (take on me)
Mine diamonds (take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two
So easy to mine with my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels
Hopefully they stay in my Minecraft chests
So I'm gonna make a lock on it
Mine diamonds
Mine diamonds
I'll mine them
So far I've got two, ah
I'm alright, I'm ready
All these diamonds sittin' carefully away
I'm getting worried if they might get stolen (turn it off)
From my ender chest
Wait, who is that?
Holy sheep, it's Notch!
Mine diamonds
Mine diamonds
Now they're safe now
Now that they're safe now
Mine diamonds
Mine diamonds
Uh, uh, thanks
Thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song
